#Problem:
#In classical mechanics, Newtonâ€™s second law states:

#F = m a where a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}

#Task:

#Write a Python program that simulates the motion of a particle in 1d under a constant force (like gravity).

#Start with initial conditions: mass m, position x0, velocity v0, and a constant force F.

#Use a small time step dt and update the velocity and position step by step.

#Run the simulation for some duration T and output the trajectory of the particle.

#Plot the trajectory using matplotlib.

#Bonus!

#Modify your code to work in 2d using numpy arrays as vectors.

#m = float(input("Initial mass (kg): "))
#x_0 = float(input("Initial position (m): "))
#v_0 = float(input("Initial velocity (m/s): "))
#constant_force = float(input("Constant force (gravity = 9.8 m/s^2 unless otherwise specified"))
#runtime = float(input("Run time (s): "))
#dt = float(input("Time step dt: "))

#def Newtonian_Int (m, x, v, F):
    #dt = 0.5
    #not sure where to go from here, will sketch it out 

    #and we're back, nearly a month later :) Jackson sent me on a side quest to Project Euler until I was ready. The day has come. I will finally write this program

    #Full disclosure, my intermech professor lowkey did this in class the other day, but I'm not referencing the code and trying to work it out myslef. 
#If we have less inputs & set system at rest at t=0
